    "Time - Overall O(n * s)\n",
    "* O(n) were n is the total number of elements, dir + files.\n",
    "* For each file we perform string search of the suffix, this operation is O(s) were the s is the length of the string.\n",
    "* If a dir is composed of (n) strings and all string are of length (s) then it would take O(n * s) to search all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space - Overall O(n)\n",
    "* Each recursive call on a dir uses space O(n), and we are keeping a list of matched elements O(n) if all elements match.\n"
