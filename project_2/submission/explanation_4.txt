### Write a function that provides an efficient lookup of whether the user is in a group.

#### Notes:
The first proposal of an algorithm:
 * For each user in the group
 * Check for user membership in that group, if true return True
 * Else for each sub-group, iterate (or recurse)

Given that sub-group could be a member of several other groups, we can potentially have a lot of repeated work. For example, if there exists a group C that is a subgroup of A and B, with the algorithm above, we would search it's users and sub-groups twice.

* The First optimization is to ensure that we cache the search results and we don't 'visit' a group more than once. This cache also handles the potential issue of cyclical group memberships, and we won't recurse if we have seen this group before.

* The Second optimization would also be to store if a user was not found in a previous group. This second cache, or perhaps a tuple value in the same cache as above, would prevent us from repeatedly searching for a user in a group that we have previously visited.

* Third possible optimization would be to invert and flatter the hierarchy. To generate a cache mapping user to groups; if this is an operation that we perform regularly and needs to be optimized, it can be an option.

For now, I'll implement the algorithm with the first optimization

Efficiency:

Time
 * Overall - O(n) * O(u) where n is the number of groups, and u is the number of users in each group.
 * For each group we perform a linear search to find if the user is in its list of users.
 * In the worst case we would have to visit every group to find a users or the user is not in not found.

Space
* Overall - O(n) n is the total number of groups in the visited cache
* We could potentially visiter every group and never find the user.
