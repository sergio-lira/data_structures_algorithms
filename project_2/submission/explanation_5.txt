### BlockChain

Notes:
    * Create a Block class that stores the content of the block and generates a hash on creation.
    * BlockChan class that contains a list of chains, each chain is initialized by a Block 0.
    * Every new block is instantiated and has a reference to the previous block hash.
    * Created two utility functions to help me populate a blockchain and visualize its contents.
    
Efficiency:
   * Time - Adding a block is done in constant time. Iterating the blockchains is done in O(n) time.
   * Space - O(b * n) where b is the number of blockchains and n is the size of each blockchain.
